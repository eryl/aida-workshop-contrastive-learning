    "# Do we need a softmax layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous notebook how the vectors for each output class of the softmax layer acts as a kind of centroid or prototype, and the neural network solves the classification problem by mapping the inputs as close as possible to these protype vectors. We could see that the \"as close to possible\" actually meant that it tries to minimize the angle between the prototype vector and the transformed examples. We explained this more explicitly has the neural network having two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is trained to map the inputs to an _intermediate representation_ which is then used to solve the problem by the decoder. In a deep neural network, it's our choice of where we want to divide the stack of layers into \"encoder\" and \"decoder\", but it often has to do with what layer we think the representations might be useful on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we described the _encoder_ and _decoder_ in the previous notebook was like this:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{z} = f_{enc}(\\mathbf{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder then maps the input vector to a categorical distribution:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = f_{dec}(\\mathbf{z})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is what drives the learning of the upstreams neural network. In our case, the decoder is simply a matrix multiplication;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = W_s \\mathbf{z} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{w}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{c} \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf{z} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{w}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{z} \\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{z} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{z} \\end{bmatrix}\n",

    "\n",
    "The $w_i$ here are our softmax vectors, and the result of our output is actually the _unscaled_ cosine of the angle between the transformed input and our softmax vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that instead of having some _fixed_ prototype vector we dynamically compute these vectors. Let's take one data point per each of our $k$ classes, we'll call them $\\mathbf{x}_{c_1}, \\mathbf{x}_{c_2}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_{c_k}$. Instead of having a fixed and learned softmax weight $w_{c_i}$ we will use our encoder to compute these: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we want to do this? One important thing to notice is that we've now freed ourselves from the constraint of having _exactly_ $K$ output vectors (one for each class). We could instead easily extend the number of classes we have without having to retrain the network. While this is neat, the real reason for doing this comes when we ask ourselves _\"what vectors should we choose to be the $f_{enc}(\\mathbf{x}_{c_i})$ vectors?\"_\n",

    "On the face of it, the above formulation doesn't really give us anything, we've just replaced the softmax vectors with free parameters to some vectors computed by the network. If we trained using this formulation, we would still get to the same place: the network would try to move all the inputs of a class close to its corresponding prototype. We're encouraging the network to learn a _similarity_ between the protype vector and the training data. This is a very powerful idea which we can use to instead of just learning a mapping to some fixed set of vectors, we try to learn a mapping to a _space_ where similar things are close together. The goal of doing this is to get more _general_ representaitons, in particular for transfer learning. \n",

    "With the change we've now done, we're longer really modelling a categorical probability distribution. We still wan't to achive something similar as we did before, that the learning objective leads to a encoder which maps our data into a new \"neural\" space, where things which are similar (according to us humans) are close together (according to some metric). We saw in the previous example that the cross-entropy loss (what we used to train our spherical softmax)  worked to produce these kind of representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can still use the softmax and cross entropy, and to get an intuition into what this would model let's go back to the classification model. When training a classifier, we're modelling the probability that a certain input (e.g. an image) should be associated with a certain label. When we switch to the setup we've discribed, we instead model the probability that an image should be associated with another set of images.\n",

    "We now have two different modalities; one is the image and we'll use a resnet like before. The other modality is text; and to make this workshop simple we'll use a pretrained neural network to get the text modality. [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) from OpenAI is an easy to use, very powerful, multimodal model where we will use its text encoder for our dataset. We will not train the text encoder now, but instead use it to practically compute dynamic softmax vectors like we discussed previously."
